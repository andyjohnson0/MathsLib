# SimpMathsLibleGps


## Description

MathsLib is an implementation of a subset of the mathematical primitives found in the System.Math
class. It is based on some abandoned work for a navigation appliance
(see [SimpleGPS](https://github.com/andyjohnson0/SimpleGps)) that used a now obsolete platform
that lacked maths primities. This clode is cleaned-up and fixed and adds fairly extensive tests.

The main motivation for this was a learning exercise. As such, it emphasises readability over
efficiency and mathematical rigour.
